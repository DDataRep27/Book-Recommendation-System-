# Book-Recommendation-System-
* In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, books to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).

* Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors.


# Problem Statement
**In this project, we will examine the data and build a book recommendation engine that will recommend the books to the users.**

### Note:
* Have used the Popularity & Collaborative based filtering method to build a book recommender system for this project. 



**Successfully build the model, and deployed on streamlit-cloud**
